    <h4>About Me</h4> <br>
    <img src="../Images/WIN_20240918_21_19_58_Pro.jpg" width="200" alt="Emily and David"><br>
        The above picture is of my wonderful bride, Emily. And I'm there too. I'm a Pre-law student at Brigham Young University in my second year of college.
        I've been at my current job, a member service representative at Utah Community Credit Union, for about a year. My goal is to become a Constitutional lawyer. <br>
        <img src="../Images/New Groove.webp" width="300" alt="New Groove Movie Poster"> 
<ul class="bold">Random Things I Like
    <li>The Emperors New Groove. Such a good movie.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>First off, Kronk. Brilliant character design.</li>
        <li>The dialogue is so quotable. Never been matched.</li>
        <li>Kuzko randomly jumping in to offer his thoughts for the first part of the movie. So good. </li>
    </ol>
    <li>80s Rock. Music peaked in the 80s and has gone downhill since.</li>
    <li>Hanging upside down.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="bold">Amendments to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/">the Constitution</a>  I think are most important
    <li>2nd. This is the right that allows the rest of them to exist. If we lose this, we lose them all.</li>
    <li>1st. This amendment is really the basis of our society and the essential piece upholding our freedom.</li>
    <li>10th. Reserving all abilities not given to the federal government to the states was a brilliant move that needs to be enforced more often.</li>
</ol>

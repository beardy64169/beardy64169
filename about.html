                        <p>I was about 7 when I first heard Glenn Beck defending the Constitution of the United States. I was in my grandma’s backseat driving through Salem, a very small town in Utah, when his voice came through the radio. I was entranced. I didn’t want it to end. That was the first time I felt a call, a call to defend the Founding Fathers legacy and the Constitution of the United States of America.<p></p>
                            Over the next 7 years, I started studying history. I visited towns all over the east coast, Jamestown, Yorktown, Philadelphia, Jefferson Davis’ home, Mount Vernon, Montecello, Fort Sumter, and Gettysburg were only a few of the places I visited, drinking in their history and even receiving a quill from one of my heroes, Thomas Jefferson, in Yorktown. I loved it all. I couldn’t get enough. I started reading about politics and history with Glenn Beck remaining a favorite resource, although I started spreading out. As I studied, I started noticing something; God was a prominent part of the founding of the United States, and now I can’t mention Him in public schools. That confounded me for years. And where was this “separation of church and state” people kept mentioning in the Constitution? I couldn’t find it. So why was it featured so prominently in political discourse?<p></p>  
                            It took longer than I wanted it to before I found a satisfying answer in Original Intent: The Courts, the Constitution, and Religion by David Barton, which is a book explaining the ways the Supreme Court has distorted the freedom of religion as listed in the first amendment. This has been a life-changing read. It explained each of the major Supreme Court decisions that led to the current state of religion in the United States and provided quotes from the Founding Fathers, which Barton defines at the beginning of the book for clarity, showing that the current understanding of freedom of religion is not what the Founding Fathers would have understood it to be. This is when I got the idea of going to law school, a place where I could defend the Constitution in a way that can affect change. <p></p>
                            Since then, I’ve had some experiences that lead me to think I would be good at being a lawyer. While teaching about the Gospel of Jesus Christ on my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I learned I was good at memorizing long passages of complex text and reciting them at will. Not only that, when asked a question I would have an answer come to mind, fully formed, with premises, supporting scriptures, and the conclusion written out so all I had to do was read the script that jumped to mind. That ability to memorize and use long and complex texts will serve me well in law school and in my future career.  <p></p>
                            I see restoring the original understanding of the Constitution, and especially the first amendment, as an essential responsibility for every citizen of the United States and for me specifically. I feel called to defend it in whatever way I can, and I believe becoming a lawyer will be an efficient and useful way to defend the Constitution.
